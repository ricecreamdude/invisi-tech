<!-- //Here's the task: Given an array of inputs (location name, postal code), return the current time and weather for those locations. -->


<!-- 
The input is an array. The array elements can be a postal code, a name of a city, or something invalid ;).

The output is up to you, but can be either an array or an object. Each element has to have the local time, and "weather" (what this means is up to you).

We aren't checking your code against automated tests or anything like that, we just want to see how you think. Thanks -->
